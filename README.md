# tikTakTow

* Here is my first application: a single player version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe.
* Although it appears minimalist at first, this project uses token authentication
through an API to store information about users and past games.
* The app also uses AJAX calls to allow the user to seamlessly flow
from creating an account to playing the game.

## User stories

* As a first time user, I want to be able to create an account
with a password that I confirm.
* As a first time user, I want to be able to sign in only with the password I created.
* As a signed in user, I want to be able to change my password.
* As a signed in user, I want to be able to log out.
* As a signed in user, I want to see how many games I’ve played.
* As a signed in user, I want to be able to create a new game (at any time).
* As a signed in user, I want to play the game with traditional rules
(x goes first and alternates with o, only open spaces can be chosen,
the first to three in a row horizontally/vertically/diagonally wins
and the game ends.
* As a signed in user, I want to see messaging that guides my user experience.
* As a signed in user, I don’t want to see unnecessary information (inputs, buttons

## Unresolved Issues & Stretch Goals

I would like to continue to improve the styling and the user interface.
For styling, I would add animations to enhance moments when a user story
is successfully completed, rather than just displaying a message as it
does currently. I would also utilize media query styling and bootstrap
to make sure my app looks good “mobile-first”.  For the user interface,
I would put input fields in buttons into a drop down or a navigation bar.
Ideally, my user is only seeing one or two things at once so they can
move seamlessly through the game. I would also move some of my messaging
into modals for a more slick, professional presentation.
